# ProgPulse-Guide
An expert system for best matching programming language recommendation

“ProgPulse Guide” is an expert system that I have designed and implemented for an assignment of Logic Programming and Artificial Cognitive System module.This expert system represents a fusion of artificial intelligence and domain expertise, aiming to empower individuals seeking to embark on a coding journey with a tailored and informed decision.
The main goal of this expert system is assesing different programming languages and frameworks ,considering how they match with specific project requirements and personal preferences.The system understands the details and how everything fits together, so it can recommend the best matching programming language or framework that needs to be learnt by a particular user.
